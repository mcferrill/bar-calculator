Bar Calculator
==============

This is a simple one-page webapp that calculates what barbell plates to use for a given target weight and bar.

The repo doubles as a playground to practice and learn multiple web development approaches using different frameworks such as Vue.js_ &
React_. Eventually this will include native-mobile versions based on those same frameworks. This results in a convenient workflow whereby
mobile apps can be quickly prototyped in the browser and adapted relatively easily into native mobile solutions if viable.

The current version can be found on netlify:

* Vanilla JS: `/vanilla`_
* Vue: `/ (default)`_
